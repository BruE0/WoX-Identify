# Might & Magic IV & V - World of Xeen -- Equipment Identifier for cheapskates.

## I made this because I was annoyed

#### I'm not a _real_ programmer so... yeah (it works though).

Don't expect anything out of it. Information contained within is 13% reliable, unless it is a full moon, then it is 24% reliable.

Are you tired of not knowing if **Flaming** is better than **Burning**? Are you tired of thinking "what the heck does Sonic mean?", and then afterwards realizing it has to do with energy(?) and not wind (because why not). 

**Say no more.**

Run `world_of_xeen_equipmentcompare.py`and be ~even more pissed off~ mildy happy. It still won't help you fight the Mega Dragon:dragon_face: so good luck.

TO DO List:
- [X] Use tkinter like a moron.
- [X] Use already available information because of lazyness ♥[Gamefaq's](https://bit.ly/2Iajrox)
- [ ] Check if the GUI displays accurate results. (14.23% done)

#### There's a .exe version for those on Windows 10 x64 who can't install Python. May or may not work. Check [/dist](https://github.com/BruE0/WoX-Identify/tree/master/dist/world_of_xeen_equipmentcompare)
